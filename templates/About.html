  <p>W-REAL-M is the must-have sexy, sophisticated fashion brand for work, the weekend, or going out. It's what's new and what's now for young fashion-forward women and men. We started more than thirty years ago as an experiment - an offshoot of another successful retail concept. There was nothing but opportunity in front of us and we took it.</p>

    
<p>We arenâ€™t inventors - there are so few of those in the world of fashion today - nor are we imitators, that is far too easy.  At W-REAL-M, we are innovators. We find inspiration and trends from all over the world and interpret them in a way that is uniquely W-REAL-M. And we have become the preferred destination for the latest trends.</p>

   
<p>W-REAL-M is a specialty apparel and accessories retailer of women's and men's merchandise, targeting the 20 to 30 year old customer. The Company has over 30 years of experience offering a distinct combination of fashion and quality for multiple lifestyle occasions at an attractive value addressing fashion needs across work, casual, jeanswear, and going-out occasions. The Company currently operates more than 600 retail and factory outlet stores, located primarily in high-traffic shopping malls, lifestyle centers, and street locations across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. W-REAL-M merchandise is also available at franchise stores in the Middle East and Latin America. The Company also markets and sells its products through the Company's online store, www.wrealm.com.</p>
